# 👋 Hi, I'm Madhuri  
### Web3 Builder | Blockchain Strategist | Founder of SSTAR  
*(GitHub: Maddy-Bathula)*

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I’m an International Business graduate passionate about the future of **Web3, blockchain ecosystems, NFTs, and decentralised communities**.  

Although I don’t come from a traditional coding background, I actively **build real blockchain projects** to deepen my understanding of token creation, NFT standards, and the business models behind decentralised products.

My goal is to work in **Web3 strategy, product, operations, partnerships, and ecosystem growth**, combining my business experience with hands-on blockchain experimentation.
